Sprint1: Unsupervised Learning
--
### What is unsupervised learning?
<p> Unsupervised learning can be considered as a way to reduce the dimensions. Most of the unsupervised learning are a form of cluster analysis: some objects in the clusters are very similar while others are distinct. <p>
  
### Where is it currently used?
<p> In the real world, we can use k-means clustering to site cell phone towers; we can also use Fuzzy c-Means Clustering to analyze Gene Expression Data. Using self-organizing map, neural network based clustering can transform a dataset into a topology-preserving 2D map. <p>
  
Sprint2: Individual Report: Snorkel
--

### Introduction to the topic
### Summary of references
<p> New Snorkel is about labeling the training data, and expand it into transformation and slicing. <p>

### Analysis of results including pros and cons. 

* Advantage
Snorkel can apply many different kinds of models, inclusting MLP and LGTM. Comparing with R, we can find a better accuracy rate quickly. In R, we need to build a model each time.

* Disadvantage
We still need to do a lot of things in labeling, it might not be approperiate to use in the text, especially in a small-scale dataset.

### Recommendations for a person who want to develop or use such systems
<p> Snorkel is helpful to deal with images. <p>
  
### Conclusions
<p> We still have a long way to solve the unsupervised learning. <p>

Sprint3: Group Report: Learning from each other
--
<p> The reports from our group can be divided into two groups: general questions and applications. In the general question group, it is easy for the author to copy and paste too much or use a wrong writing style. In the application group, author might stop in a specific model or project, ignoring the topic of the group. If you can distinguish the related concepts, just do it; if you can draw a figure by yourself, just do it. <p>
