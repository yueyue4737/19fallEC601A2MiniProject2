State of the art of unsupervised learning and where it is being currently used: Snorkel
=======
Sprint1: Choose the Topic
=======
### Why this topic?
<p> It will help me focus on the term project. <p>

### What is unsupervised learning?
<p> Unsupervised learning is about data without labeling. The main shortcoming of our topic is that not all of us strictly say about unsupervised learning. <p>
  
### Where can I use snorkel in the course?
<p> Starting from images, and them we will know whether the topic is good for the natural language or not. <p>
  
Sprint2: Report:Snorkel
======

### Introduction to the topic
### Summary of references
<p> New Snorkel is about labeling the training data, and expand it into transformation and slicing. <p>

### Analysis of results including pros and cons. 

* Advantage
Snorkel can apply many different kinds of models, inclusting MLP and LGTM. Comparing with R, we can find a better accuracy rate quickly. In R, we need to build a model each time.

* Disadvantage
We still need to do a lot of things in labeling, it might not be approperiate to use in the text, especially in a small-scale dataset.

### Recommendations for a person who want to develop or use such systems
<p> Snorkel is helpful to deal with images. <p>
  
### Conclusions
<p> We still have a long way to solve the unsupervised learning. <p>

Sprint3: Group Discussion
======================================
<p> Some of us slect a broad topic, while others just change the topic. It is not good to do things in that way. <p>
